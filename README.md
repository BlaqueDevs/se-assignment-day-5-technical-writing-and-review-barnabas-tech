## 9. How do headings and subheadings improve the readability and organization of technical documents?
Clarity and Conciseness:
Use clear, concise language that accurately reflects the section's content.
Avoid jargon or overly technical terms when possible.
Logical Hierarchy:
Use a consistent heading structure (H1, H2, H3, etc.) to indicate the relative importance of sections.
Ensure that subheadings logically support their parent headings.
Consistency:
Maintain a consistent style and formatting for all headings and subheadings throughout the document.
Maintain consistant gramatical structure.
Specificity:
Headings should be specific and informative, giving readers a clear idea of what to expect in the section.
Keyword Usage:

Brevity:
Keep headings short. Long headings can be hard to read, and can clutter a document.
